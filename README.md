Stock Price Simulation and Option Pricing

This Python program simulates stock prices using Geometric Brownian Motion, calculates put option prices using the Black-Scholes formula, and evaluates the total position value over a specified time horizon. It also generates visualizations of the stock prices and total position value over time.

Features

	•	Simulates stock prices over a given time horizon using Geometric Brownian Motion.
	•	Calculates put option prices using the Black-Scholes formula.
	•	Allows dynamic adjustment of put options based on a trigger price.
	•	Computes the total position value considering margin interest.
	•	Generates plots for:
	•	Simulated stock prices over time.
	•	Investor’s total position value over time.
	•	Stock price and put strike price over time.
	•	Stores simulation results in CSV files for further analysis.

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.x installed on your system.
	•	Basic understanding of financial concepts like stock pricing, options, and margin trading.


Installation

	1.	Clone the Repository:
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-option-simulation.git

	2.	Navigate to the Project Directory:
        
        $ cd stock-option-simulation

	3.	Install Required Python Packages:
        You can install the required packages using pip:
        pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

Parameters

The program requires several input parameters to perform the simulation. You can either input them manually when prompted or modify the default values in the code.
	•	Initial Equity Price (initial_equity_price): The starting price of the stock (e.g., $40.0).
	•	Strike Price for PUT (strike_price_PUT): The strike price of the initial put option (e.g., $35.0).
	•	Trigger Price for PUT (trigger_price_PUT): The stock price at which you adjust the put option (e.g., $40.0).
	•	Time Horizon (time_horizon): Total number of days to simulate (e.g., 90).
	•	Time Step (time_step): Number of trading days in a year (typically 252).
	•	Annual Expected Return (annual_expected_return): Expected annual return of the stock (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
	•	Volatility (volatility): Annual volatility of the stock price (e.g., 0.3 for 30%).
	•	Risk-Free Rate (risk_free_rate): Annual risk-free interest rate (e.g., 0.01 for 1%).
	•	Trigger Price (trigger_price): Stock price at which you adjust your strategy (e.g., $42.5).
	•	Number of Shares (num_shares): Number of shares purchased (e.g., 1000).
	•	Number of Put Contracts (num_puts): Number of put option contracts (e.g., 10).
	•	Margin Requirement (margin_requirement): Percentage of the stock purchase price that must be covered by cash (e.g., 0.5 for 50%).
	•	Margin Rate (margin_rate): Annual interest rate charged on borrowed funds (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).


Output
Sample Graphs:
    •	simulated_stock_prices.png: Plot of simulated stock prices over time.
    •	total_position_value.png: Plot of the investor’s total position value over time.
    •	stock_put_price_plot.png: Plot showing both stock price and put strike price over time.

The program generates the following outputs:
	•	Console Output:
	•	Displays user-defined parameters.
	•	Shows simulation data in tabular form.
	•	Provides actions taken during the simulation (e.g., adjusting put options).
	•	CSV Files:
	•	simulated_stock_prices.csv: Contains simulated stock prices over time.
	•	simulation_results.csv: Contains detailed simulation results, including stock price, put option value, margin interest, total position value, and actions.
	•	Graphs:
	•	simulated_stock_prices.png: Plot of simulated stock prices over time.
	•	total_position_value.png: Plot of the investor’s total position value over time.
	•	stock_put_price_plot.png: Plot showing both stock price and put strike price over time.
The graphs are saved in the same directory as the script.
